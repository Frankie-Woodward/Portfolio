 Installation instructions

 Your User stories – who are your users, what do they want and why?
 The users of the website are future employers, peers, visitors, as well as family/friends. Their goal is to enter my site and find out who I am and what I know in the least amount of time.

 Your Wireframes – sketches of major views / interfaces in your application
 Bootsrap for background color interface to dark mode, as well as for the navbar insert

 Descriptions of any Unsolved problems or major hurdles you had to overcome
    1. Implementing the navar was a headache, as I tried to build one from scratch. I tried to mimic the class example, but took too long and overcomplicated the situation. So I went with a Bootstrap design for the navbar
    2. I had multiple formatting issues with creating flex grids/boxes, and spent a lot of time custom changing font sizes and content alignment.
    3. I am still perfecting the dark mode style on my portfolio. My biggest issue is overthinking/complicating problems as well as starting too ambitous with project ideas.
    4. I also wanted the navbar on the right side. But, since its using Bootsrap framework, I wasn't able to figure it out as of yet.

 Descriptions of next steps you have planned for your application
    1. I plan to implement a messaging to email box (its on the page, just not active at the moment)
    2. Formatting changes and updates to look more polished
    3. Updates to Projects and including carousel with information of each project
